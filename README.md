# serverless-chat

ğŸš§ **This project is still under construction and might not work perfectly!** ğŸš§

Simple serverless chat app created with Nuxt.js, connected to google cloud tools like Firebase Authentication and Firebase Realtime Database.

<!-- The app can be accessed through the static hosting service Firebase Hosting, at <a href="https://serverless-chat-a3350.web.app/">https://serverless-chat-a3350.web.app/</a>, and can be installed as a PWA. -->

This project was coded as an experiment, during my free time ğŸ˜‹
